I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.kennesaw.edu/spceet/academics/industrial-systems-engineering/index.php) at [Kennesaw State University (KSU)](https://www.kennesaw.edu/). Before joining KSU, I was an Associate Data Scientist in the [Department of Health Services Research](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/health-services-research.html) and a Fellow at the [Institute for Data Science in Oncology (IDSO)](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/institutes/institute-for-data-science-in-oncology.html) at The [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/). I am also a member of the [National Cancer Institute-sponsored Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) Lung Working Group](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/lung/). Before joining MD Anderson, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Industrial and Systems Engineering Department](https://engineering.wayne.edu/industrial-systems) at [Wayne State University](https://wayne.edu/) (2022-2024). 

Prior to moving to the United States, I served an Assistant Professor in the Industrial Engineering Department at Alzahra University in Tehran, Iran (2021-2022). I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from the University of Tehran in 2018, where I also completed a one-year postdoctoral fellowship (2019-2020). I received my M.S. and B.S. in Industrial Engineering from K. N. Toosi University of Technology in Tehran, Iran in 2010 and 2012.

Research
======
My research interests include sequential decision-making under uncertainty (using Markov chains, Markov Decision Process, Partially Observable Markov Decision Process), multi-objective optimization, simulation and data analytics, with applications in healthcare and medical decision-making (specially in cancer care and diabetes management).
