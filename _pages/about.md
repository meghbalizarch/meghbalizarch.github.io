I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.kennesaw.edu/spceet/academics/industrial-systems-engineering/index.php) at [Kennesaw State University (KSU)](https://www.kennesaw.edu/).

<div class="highlight-box">
  <p>ðŸ“¢ <strong>Iâ€™m hiring PhD students</strong> for Fall 2025 in the areas of <strong>Healthcare Decision Analytics</strong> (sequential decision-making, modeling under uncertainty, simulation) and <strong>Health AI</strong> (risk prediction, LLMs for real-world data, and optimization in medical decision-making). If youâ€™re interested in these topics, please <a href="/join">see this page</a>.</p>

Before joining KSU, I worked as an Associate Data Scientist in the [Department of Health Services Research](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/health-services-research.html) and was a Fellow at the [Institute for Data Science in Oncology (IDSO)](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/institutes/institute-for-data-science-in-oncology.html) at [The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/). I am also a member of the [National Cancer Institute-sponsored Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) Lung Working Group](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/lung/).

## Research

My research interests include sequential decision-making under uncertainty (using Markov chains, MDPs, POMDPs), multi-objective optimization, simulation, and data analytics, with applications in healthcareâ€”especially cancer care and diabetes management.
